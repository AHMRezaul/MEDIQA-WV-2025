At home, I disinfected the wound with some alcohol and have not let it touch water since then to prevent infection. Now the wound has scabbed over (as shown in the picture). I want to ask how to care for it scientifically so that it heals quickly and the scar fades as much as possible. What should I do daily, and what is the timeline? Could you please outline the steps for me to follow? Also, can the scabbed area touch water now (like when washing my face)? Thanks in advance for your help. Additionally, how can I deal with acne marks? I have some noticeable acne marks on both sides of my face. What are the best ways to remove them? If there are effective medications, please recommend them. However, I hope they will fade on their own quickly. Thank you all!",
