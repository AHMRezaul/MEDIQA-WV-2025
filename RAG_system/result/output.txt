However, the nail does not grow any more, and the nail is sticking to the blood underneath it, and then the nail had separate from the skin around it. I have clipped the top part of the nail that was separating from the skin. The nail on the side and on the back seems intact with the skin.

It's been a month and a half, and the swelling hasn't gone down. It was a fall, and the wound was particularly deep, about half a centimeter. The area around the wound is red and swollen. When pressed, it forms a small pit that takes a long time to go back, looking like edema. What should I do?assistant

Delayed wound healing and surrounding redness and swelling of the area around the wound is suspicious for infection. Recommend evaluation in urgent care for antibiotics.user

I had surgery on my leg ten years ago, and after the stitches were removed, it seemed like the wound opened up again. After healing, the part that opened up became the scar shown in the picture. It has no sensation, feels hard with no elasticity, and the skin tends to crack easily. Is this normal? How should I take care of it daily?assistant

The scar tissue appears to be hypertrophic, which is a common complication of surgical wounds. It is not normal for the skin to crack easily, but it is possible. To take care of it daily, apply moisturizer regularly to prevent dryness and cracking. Avoid picking or scratching the area, as this can cause further irritation and infection. Consider using silicone gel or sheeting to help flatten and soften the scar tissue.

For minor dog bites or scratches, does the wound shape look like this in the picture? As shown in the picture.assistant

## Step 1: Understand the context of the question
The question is asking whether the wound shape in the provided picture is typical for minor dog bites or scratches.

## 2: Analyze the wound in the picture
The wound in the picture appears to be a small, superficial cut or scratch. It is linear with a slight angle, resembling a scratch more than a typical puncture wound.

## 3: Consider common characteristics of dog bites and scratches
Dog bites can range from superficial scratches to deep puncture wounds, often depending on the force and nature of the bite. However, scratches from dogs or other animals tend to be more superficial and can appear as linear cuts or tears in the skin.

## 4: Compare the wound in the picture to common wound types from dog bites or scratches
The wound in the picture looks more like a scratch than a typical dog bite wound. Dog bites often result in puncture wounds or more irregularly shaped wounds due to the tearing action of teeth. Scratches, on the other hand, can appear as linear or slightly curved cuts, similar to what's seen in the picture.

## 5: Conclusion
Given that the wound in the picture resembles a small, linear scratch, it could be consistent with a minor dog scratch rather than a typical dog bite.

The best answer is yes.

After being burned by boiling water and self treated, the skin fell off few days later and the wound site had some blackish yellow gangrenous tissue. Image attached. Is this concerning? What should I do next?  It was burned at night. I wrapped it the first day, and then the next day, there was blisters. I applied the burn cream again. Two days later, there was drainage coming out from the blister. I wrapped it after rinsing it with sodium chloride, and a day later, the blister ruptured, showing yellow gangrenous tissue. With no choice, I removed the grangrenous skin, rinsed it with sodium chloride, then applied burn cream and wrapped it.

This injury happened exactly a week ago. That night, after getting hurt, I immediately rinsed it with frozen Yibao. The next day, I applied red solution and disinfected it. However, the wound is on my knee, and in the past week, I’ve gone running five times. After running, yellow pus appears. I haven't let it get wet during showers, but the blood has kept coagulating, and now it has become a large piece of clotted blood. Should I continue using the red solution? I've applied it three times (yellow fluid). Should I keep using the medicine, and how long will it take to heal?assistant

I would recommend that you go to the nearest hospital for further evaluation as there may be an infection if there is pus.user

As shown in the picture, I hurt my knee while running a little over two months ago, and the scab eventually fell off. But now it looks like this, with a layer of skin and flesh underneath.  What’s going on? It's been like this for more than half a month.assistant

Based on the images provided, it appears that the wound on your knee has not healed properly. The presence of a layer of skin and flesh underneath, as well as the appearance of the wound, suggests that it may be a delayed healing process or a possible infection.

Here are some possible explanations:

* **Delayed healing**: Wounds can take time to heal, and it's not uncommon for them to go through different stages of healing. However, if the wound has not shown significant improvement in over half a month, it may be worth investigating further.
* **Infection**: The presence of pus or discharge, as well as the redness and swelling around the wound, could indicate an infection. Infections can delay the healing process and may require medical attention.
* **Irritation or allergic reaction**: The wound may be irritated or reacting to the environment, causing it to become inflamed or infected.

To better understand what's going on, I would recommend that you consult a healthcare professional for a proper evaluation and diagnosis. They can assess the wound, take a medical history, and provide guidance on the best course of treatment.

In the meantime, here are some general wound care tips:

* Keep the wound clean and dry
* Apply a topical antibiotic ointment to prevent infection
* Cover the wound with a bandage or dressing to protect it from further irritation
* Avoid picking at or scratching the wound

Please consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice and treatment.

Urgent! I'm in the 9th grade and really busy with schoolwork! Two weeks ago, I discovered my toenail had pierced into the flesh, so I cut it. I didn't expect it to leave a wound.

I was scratched by a cat through thick jeans, leaving a blood mark as shown in the picture. Do I need to get a rabies vaccine?assistant

## Step 1: Determine the risk of rabies transmission
The risk of rabies transmission through a scratch is generally lower than through a bite, but it is not zero. However, for rabies to be transmitted, the cat must be infected with the rabies virus.

## 2: Assess the severity of the wound and the exposure
The wound appears to be a scratch with some bleeding, indicating that there was some degree of exposure to the cat's saliva. However, the fact that the scratch was through thick jeans may have reduced the severity of the exposure.

## 3: Consider the vaccination status of the cat
If the cat is known to be vaccinated against rabies, the risk of transmission is significantly reduced. However, if the cat's vaccination status is unknown, further assessment is needed.

## 4: Evaluate the need for post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP)
Post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP), which includes immediate washing of the wound, administration of rabies immunoglobulin, and a series of rabies vaccinations, is typically recommended for individuals who have been bitten or scratched by an animal suspected of having rabies.

## 5: Conclusion based on general guidelines
Given that the cat's vaccination status is not provided and assuming the cat is not confirmed to be rabies-free, caution is advised. Generally, for scratches that break the skin and draw blood, especially if the animal's rabies status is unknown, consulting a healthcare professional for a risk assessment and potential PEP is prudent.

[Urgent] How should I scientifically care for a scratch on my face so it heals quickly?
