I went to the hospital the next day for an X-ray, and there was no bone damage, so they told me to rest at home. Now it's the fourth day. The impact area has turned purple, it doesn't hurt much, but there's a lot of blood and swelling below my ankle, and there are blue bruises. When the impacted area bears weight, the parallel area to the above fibula will hurt. My biggest concern is that after lying flat for a long time or elevating my leg, when I stand up, even without putting weight on the injured leg, I will have a sudden stabbing pain and a throbbing sensation as if blood or some fluid is pooling in the leg and can’t flow properly. What’s injured here? How should I treat it?",
